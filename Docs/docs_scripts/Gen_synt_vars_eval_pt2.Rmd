# Introduction 

The second part of the evaluation of synthetic variables estimation consists in creating a set of 
summary documents that will part of an appendix to the SDM codebook. These documents will be created 
with `r markdown` and related packages (e.g. `bookdown`, `knitr`, `kableExtra`) using the information 
collected in our previous step. 

The creation of documents summarizing synthetic variables estimation is needed for transparency and 
reproducibility sake. Synthetic variables are the only variables of the SDM created with procedures that 
bo beyond basic transformations of existing variables. Hence, we must provide a summary of the 
statistical models to the prospective SDM users, including workarounds for solving some issues faced in 
estimating our synthetic variables. 

# Reviewing and summarizing our evaluation scripts, selecting relevant information

The first step for creating our summary documents consists in determining which information should be 
included. As you saw during the last two weeks, the existing evaluation scripts provide a lot of 
information that we actually might not need. The workflow used for evaluating the synthetic variables 
can (and should) be improved in order to become less redundant, more clear and concise. Thus,
