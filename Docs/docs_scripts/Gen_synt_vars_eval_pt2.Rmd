<!-- # Summarizing evaluation and workarounds  -->
  
  <!-- The creation of documents summarizing synthetic variables estimation is needed, first and foremost,  -->
  <!-- because synthetic variables are the only variables of the SDM created with regression models. Hence, we  -->
  <!-- must provide a summary of the estimation process to the prospective SDM users. Second, as already noted,  -->
  <!-- part of said regression models (especially logistic models) return problematic coefficients and some of  -->
  <!-- them do not convergence. Consequently, for transparency and reproducibility sake, we must provide an  -->
  <!-- explanation of how we dealt with said issues.  -->
