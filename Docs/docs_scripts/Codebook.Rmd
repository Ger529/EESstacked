# Preface {-}
This document consists in the codebook of a stacked data matrix (SDM) based on the data set of the 2019 
European Election Studies (EES) voter study. The creation of this SDM is part of the research activities 
of [ProConEU](https://www.mzes.uni-mannheim.de/proconeu/), a research project aiming to analyse the 
enlarging gaps between proponents and opponents of the European Integration in terms of party politics, 
citizen politics and social media communication. The project is funded by the German Federal Ministry of 
Education and Research, and it involves MZES Mannheim, LMU Munich, University of Thessaloniki, University 
of Newcastle.

# Overview of the data file {-}

The variables of the dataset are grouped first according to their relationship with the set of variables 
available in the 2019 EES voter study. The first 132 variables consist in the original variables of said 
data set, while the remaining 27 are variables computed from the former ones. This codebook refers to 
the latter set.  

The variables computed for the SDM are then grouped as it follows: 

*  **Identification variables**: A set of variables computed in order to identify EES 2019 respondents',
their national contexts, the relevant parties of said contexts, and the dyadic relationships between 
respondents and relevant parties, namely the SDM observations. Said variables do not share a common 
suffix;

*  **Recoded variables**: These variables consist in the building blocks of the generic variables 
presented below. More specifically they represent recoded versions of a subset of variables composing 
the original EES 2019 voter study data set. Said variables are identified by the suffix `_rec`;

*  **Generic variables**: concern the dyadic relationships that consist in the specific unit of analysis 
of the SDM approach, namely the relationship between each voter and each relevant party in a given party 
system. These variables share the suffix `_gen`. 





# Identification Variables {-}

## respid {-}
Unique identifier of individual respondents as it was assigned in the EES 2019 voter study 
(`respid`; See the [EES2019 Codebook](https://dbk.gesis.org/dbksearch/download.asp?id=67448)).

## party {-}
Unique identifier of the relevant parties participating to the European Parliament (EP) elections of 
2019. Only parties for which the EES 2019 voter study propensity to vote (PTV) variable is available 
have been selected. Values equate to those defined in the original EES 2019 vote choice variable 
referring to the 2019 EP elections 
(`Q7`; See the [EES2019 Codebook](https://dbk.gesis.org/dbksearch/download.asp?id=67448)). 

## stack {-} 
Unique identifier combining respondent (`respid`) and party (`party`) identifiers. 

# Generic Dichotomous Variables {-}

## Q2_gen {-}
Dichotomous choice variable, measuring whether the respondent believes that the stack 
party (`party`) would be best at dealing with the problem specified in `Q1`. 

Values: 

0 - Respondent does not consider the stack party the best at dealing with the most important issue  
1 - Respondent considers the stack party the best at dealing with the most important issue  
96 - Not applicable (Answer to EES2019 Q1 = Don't know)  
98 - Respondent does not know 

## Q7_gen {-}
Dichotomous vote choice variable, measuring whether the respondent (recalls to have) voted for the stack 
party (`party`). Recoded from the EES 2019 original vote choice variable (`votech`).

Values:

0 - Respondent did not vote for the stack party (Voted for another party, or did not vote, or voted blank or nil)  
1 - Respondent voted for the stack party  
98 - Respondent does not remember

## Q9_rec_gen {-}
Dichotomous vote choice variable, measuring which party the respondent (recalls to have) voted for at the last (national) general 
election. This variable was created from a recoded version of the original EES 2019 `Q9` variable.

Values:

0 - Respondent did not vote for the stack party (Voted for another party, or did not vote, or voted blank or nil)  
1 - Respondent voted for the stack party  
98 - Respondent does not remember

## Q25_rec_gen {-}
Dichotomous choice variable, measuring which party the respondent feels close to (party identification).
This variable was created from a recoded version of the original EES 2019 `Q25` variable.

Values:

0 - Respondent does not feel close to the stack party (Feels close to another party or does not feel close to any)  
1 - Respondent feels close to the stack party  
98 - Respondent does not know

# Generic distance/proximity variables estimation {-}

## Q10_gen {-}
Generic distance/proximity variable, measuring the respondent’s propensity to vote for a specific party.
This variable was created from a recoded version of the original EES 2019 `Q10` variable.

Values:

0.0 - Respondent does not feel close to the stack party
1.0 - Respondent feels close to the stack party  
98.0 - Respondent does not know


## Q11_Q13_gen {-}
Generic distance/proximity variable, measuring the distance of the respondents' self-placement on the left-right ideological axis, variable `Q11`, and the respondent’s perception of a specific party position on the same left-right continuum, variable `Q13`.
This variable was created from the EES2019 `Q11` and `Q13` variable.

Values:

98.000000000 - Respondent does not know


## Q23_Q24_gen {-}
Generic distance/proximity variable, measuring the distance of the respondents' self-placement on the position taken about EU integration, variable `Q23`, and the repondent’s perception of a specific party position about the EU integration process, variable `Q24`.
This variable was created from the EES2019 `Q23` and `Q24` variable.

Values:

98.000000000 - Respondent does not know

# Synthetic variables estimation {-}

## socdem_synt_ptv {-}
Synthetic variable, measuring the affinity between the respondents' socio-demographic characteristics and their propensity to vote. This was estimated using a linear prediction of an OLS model. The dependent Variable of this regression analysis was `Q7_gen` (see: Generic Dichotomous Variables) and the independent variables `D3_rec`, `D5_rec`, `D8_rec`, `EDU_rec`, `D4_age` and `D10_rec` (see below).

## socdem_synt_vc {-}
Synthetic variable, measuring the affinity between the respondents' socio-demographic characteristics and their vote choice. This was estimated using linear predictions of a set of logit model. The dependent Variable of these regression analyses was `Q10_gen` (see: Generic distance/proximity variables estimation) and the independent variables `D3_rec`, `D5_rec`, `D8_rec`, `EDU_rec`, `D4_age` and `D10_rec` (see below).

## Independent variables for socdem_synt_ptv and socdem_synt_vc estimation {-} 

### Categorical independent variables: {-}
* `D3_rec`: Respondent's gender (0 = Male, 1 = Female), recoded from the original `D3` EES2019 variable (categorical);
* `D5_rec`: Whether the respondent is married/remarried/single living with a partner (1) or single/divorced/separated/widowed (0), recoded from the original `D5` EES2019 variable (categorical);
* `D8_rec`: Whether the respondent lives in a rural (0) or urban area (1), recoded from the original `D8` variable (categorical);
* `EDU_rec`: Respondent's years of formal education (1 = 15 years or less, 2 = 16-19 years, 3 = 20+);

### Continuous independent variables: {-}
* `D4_age`: Respondent's age, recoded from the original `D4_1` (year of birth) EES2019 variable (ordinal treated as continuous);
* `D10_rec`: Respondent's religiosity, recoded from the original `D10` EES2019 variable (ordinal treated as continuous). In particular, the values (min = 0, max = 6) are inverted, so that higher values indicate stronger religiosity and lower values indicate low/none religiosity.
