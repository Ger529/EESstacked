ProConEU team. ...

The variables available in the dataset are grouped as it follows: ...


# Identification Variables {-}

## respid {-}
Unique identifier of individual respondents as it was assigned in the EES 2019 Italian voter study

## party {-}

Unique identifier combining respondent (`respid`) and party (`party`) identifiers. 

# Generic Dichotomous Variables {-}

## Q2_gen {-}

party (`party`) would be best at dealing with the problem specified in `Q1`.

0 - Respondent does not consider the stack party the best at dealing with the most important issue
