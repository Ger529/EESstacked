# Synthetic variables estimation models {-}

## Dependent variables {-}

* Q10 for OLS models;
* Q7 for logit models.

## Independent variables  {-}

* D3_rec: R gender variable (male = 1, female = 2); 
* D4_age: R age variable; 
* D5_rec: R marital status variable (0 = single/notmarried/divorced; 1 = married);
* EDU_rec: Education variable (0 = low edu; 1 = middle edu; 2 = high edu).

## Regression models {-}

In their standard form, PTV or vote choice for the stack party is regressed all the selected independent 
variables. 

# Issues  {-}

In a set of countries some regression models (especially logistic ones) return or excessively high 
standard errors values or do not properly converge. In most cases such problem is derived by empty 
categories in some predictors.

## Croatian sample  {-}
