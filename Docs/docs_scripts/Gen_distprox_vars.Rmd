## Which Variables

The sole 'non-proximity' variable that we have to compute is **`Q26`**. This variable measures the 
extent to which the respondent feels close to the party identified in `Q25_rec`. 
This var is needed for computing another variable in accordance to the `Q25_rec` values.


The list of **proximity/distance** variables is the following: 

* **`Q10`**: Respondent's propensity to vote for a specific party;
* **`Q11`**: Respondent's self-placement on the left-right *continuum*;
* **`Q13`**: Respondent's perception of a specific party position on the left-right *continuum*;
* **`Q23`**: Respondent's position about EU integration^[In the original 
[EES 2019 Master Questionnaire](https://dbk.gesis.org/dbksearch/download.asp?id=67447) reference is made 
to EU *unification* rather than *integration* process. Nonetheless, the two concepts can be considered 
almost equivalent.];
* **`Q24`**: Respondent's perception of a specific party position on the EU integration process.
