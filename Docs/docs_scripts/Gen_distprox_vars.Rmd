# Introduction 

Our next tasks consist in (1) the estimation of generic **distance/proximity** variables and (2) the 
preparation of the SDM codebook.

The workflow follows up the one used for our previous task: we will modify the 'genvars' country-specific 
scripts developed a few days ago, adding the computation of the distance/proximity variables. 

# Estimating Generic Distance/Proximity Variables and Codebook Preparation

As suggested by their name, distance/proximity variables concern the distance or proximity between the 
voter and the set of relevant parties on some dimensions of interest. Thus, such variables measure 
whether and to what extent the position of an individual is more or less close to/distant from the 
position of a party on general dimensions (for istance, the left-right continuum) or on specific issues 
(such as European integration, immigration policies, minority rights, and so on). As shown below, we 
will estimate distance rather than proximity variables. Thus, the higher the values of such variables 
the more distant a specific voter and a specific party are. 

Basically, for estimating such variables we use a geometric distance formula: 

> $d = \sqrt{(x_i - x_k)^2 + (y_i - y_k)}$

Where $x_i$ and $y_i$ represent the positions of individual $i$ on issues $x$ and $y$, and $x_k$ and 
$y_k$ represent the position of party $k$ on the same issues. Since we are computing individual-party 
distances on a single issue, this implies that we are estimating these distances on a single axis. 
Thus, we can drop the second half of the formula below the radical symbol, rewriting the formula as it 
follows:

> $d = \sqrt{(x_i - x_k)^2}$

Nonetheless, these values are usually computed using a similar formula, avoiding the radical and simply 
using the absolute difference of individual and party positions, that is: 

> $d = |x_i - x_k|$

This is the formula that we will use in our scripts. 


## Which Variables

The sole 'non-proximity' variable that we have to compute is **`Q26`**. This variable measures the 
extent to which the respondent feels close to the party identified in `Q25_rec`. 
This var is needed for computing another variable in accordance to the `Q25_rec` values.


The list of **proximity/distance** variables is the following: 

* **`Q10`**: Respondent's propensity to vote for a specific party;
* **`Q11`**: Respondent's self-placement on the left-right *continuum*;
* **`Q13`**: Respondent's perception of a specific party position on the left-right *continuum*;
* **`Q23`**: Respondent's position about EU integration^[In the original 
[EES 2019 Master Questionnaire](https://dbk.gesis.org/dbksearch/download.asp?id=67447) reference is made 
to EU *unification* rather than *integration* process. Nonetheless, the two concepts can be considered 
almost equivalent.];
* **`Q24`**: Respondent's perception of a specific party position on the EU integration process.
